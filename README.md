# Building

## Install Xcode

After installing Xcode, open it to begin the Command Line Tools installation. After finished, make sure that a valid CL Tool version is selected in `Xcode > Preferences > Locations > Command Line Tools`.

## Install `homebrew`

https://brew.sh/

## Install Ruby

Install a Ruby version manager such as [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv).

    $ brew update && brew install rbenv
    $ rbenv init

Install a recent ruby version:

    $ rbenv install 3.2.1
    $ rbenv global 3.2.1
    $ eval "$(rbenv init -)"

## Install Ruby dependencies

Then the project ruby dependencies (`fastlane`, etc.):

    $ gem install bundler
    $ bundle install

## Install build dependencies (brew)

    $ sh scripts/install-brew-dependencies.sh

## Add production Config file

Clone the [wallet-ios-credentials](https://github.com/blockchain/wallet-ios-credentials) repository and copy it's `Config` directory to this project root directory, it contains a `.xcconfig` for each environment:

```
Config/AuthenticationKitConfig/Dev.xcconfig
Config/AuthenticationKitConfig/Production.xcconfig
Config/AuthenticationKitConfig/Staging.xcconfig
Config/AuthenticationKitConfig/Alpha.xcconfig

Config/BlockchainConfig/Dev.xcconfig
Config/BlockchainConfig/Production.xcconfig
Config/BlockchainConfig/Staging.xcconfig
Config/BlockchainConfig/Alpha.xcconfig

Config/NetworkKitConfig/Dev.xcconfig
Config/NetworkKitConfig/Production.xcconfig
Config/NetworkKitConfig/Staging.xcconfig
Config/NetworkKitConfig/Alpha.xcconfig
```

For example, This is how `AuthenticationKitConfig/Production.xcconfig` looks like:

```
BLOCKCHAIN_URL = blockchain.com
LOGIN_URL = login.blockchain.com
GOOGLE_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY = 00000000
```

For example, This is how `BlockchainConfig/Production.xcconfig` looks like:

```
#include "../AuthenticationKitConfig/AuthenticationKit-Production.xcconfig"
#include "../NetworkKitConfig/NetworkKit-Production.xcconfig"

ASSETCATALOG_COMPILER_APPICON_NAME = AppIcon
OPENSSL_CERT_URL = blockchain.info
SIFT_ACCOUNT_ID = 00000000
SIFT_BEACON_KEY = 00000000
PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER = com.rainydayapps.Blockchain
BUNDLE_DISPLAY_NAME = Blockchain
LOGIN_UNIVERSAL_LINK = login.blockchain.com
UNIVERSAL_LINK_MODE =
INTERCOM_API_KEY = 00000000
INTERCOM_APP_ID = 00000000
BLOCKCHAIN_WALLET_PAGE_LINK = blockchainwallet.page.link
GOOGLE_RECAPTCHA_BYPASS = 
RELAY_HOST = relay.walletconnect.com
WALLET_CONNECT_PRODUCT_ID = 00000000
```

For example, This is how `NetworkKitConfig/Production.xcconfig` looks like:

```
API_URL = api.blockchain.info
CHECKOUT_ENV = live
EVERYPAY_API_URL = pay.every-pay.eu
EXCHANGE_URL = blockchainexchange.page.link/exchange
EXPLORER_SERVER = blockchain.com
ITERABLE_API_KEY = 00000000
PIN_CERTIFICATE = 1
RETAIL_CORE_URL = api.blockchain.info/nabu-gateway
WALLET_SERVER = blockchain.info
WEBSOCKET_SERVER = ws.blockchain.info
```

## Add Firebase Config Files

Clone `wallet-ios-credentials` repository and copy it's `Firebase` directory into `Blockchain` directory, it contains a `GoogleService-Info.plist` for each environment.

```
Firebase/Dev/GoogleService-Info.plist
Firebase/Prod/GoogleService-Info.plist
Firebase/Staging/GoogleService-Info.plist
Firebase/Alpha/GoogleService-Info.plist
```

## Add environment variables for scripts

Clone `wallet-ios-credentials` repository and copy the `env` to the root folder of the project, hide the file by using `mv env .env`

## XcodeGen

We are integrating XcodeGen and, despite still committing project files in git, we should generate project files using the following script:

### Installing:

    $ brew install xcodegen

## Generate projects & dependencies: 

    $ sh scripts/bootstrap.sh

⚠️ You may need to run the following command if you encounter an `xcode-select` error:

    $ sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer

## Build the project

    cmd-r

# Modules

Please refer to the [README](./Modules/README.md) in the `Modules` directory.
Please also refer to the [README](./TestKit/README.md) in the `TestKit` directory.

# Troubleshooting LFS

In case `git` shows some files as modified when they were not and displays this warning `Encountered x file(s) that should have been pointers, but weren't:` when trying to checkout, try first this command sequence:
```
git lfs uninstall
git reset --hard
git lfs install
git lfs pull
```

If it didn't work, this sequence should:
```
git rm --cached -r .
git reset --hard
git rm .gitattributes
git reset .
git checkout .
```
