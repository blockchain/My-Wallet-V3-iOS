# My-Wallet-V3-iOS


# Building

## Setup git submodules

Prepare SocketRocket:

    git submodule update --init

Prepare the MyWallet Javascript:

    # install and build js files
    sh scripts/install-js.sh && sh scripts/build-js.sh

    # build js files, watch My-Wallet-V3 for changes
    sh scripts/watch-js.sh

Prepare OpenSSL:

    cd ../OpenSSL-for-iPhone
    ./build-libssl.sh

## PSD and Asset Catalog

Images.xcassets contains all images the app needs, but they must be generated first from the PSD sources in /Artwork. This requires ImageMagick and Grunt.

Install ImageMagic, e.g. with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh):

    brew install imagemagick

Once:

    npm install -g grunt-cli
    cd Artwork
    npm install
    npm -g install svgexport@0.2.8

Whenever you change a PSD or SVG file, run:

    grunt

The reason that the PNG files are not in the repository - even though it would make life easier for other developers - is that the resulting PNG files are not deterministic. This causes git to mark all images as changed every time you run Grunt.

## Open the project in Xcode

    open Blockchain.xcodeproj

## Build the project

    cmd-r
